<h2>Essential readings in computer science</h2>
<p><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month">The mythical man month</a> from Fred Brooks is the most essential reading if you are curious in software. Concepts from this book will keep reappearing in the 'essential articles' that I list below. After reading it, you can consider reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coders_at_work">Coders at work</a> for recent 'best-practices' (wink wink) on  software engineering.</p>

    <td>Paul Graham</td>
    <td>Usually quoted in its last paragraph (that advises against software patterns), this article is actually about why and how programming languages are different from each other, and why you should not stick to the industry standard in choosing the language.</td>
    <td>QUOTE: The disadvantage of believing that all programming languages are equivalent is that it's not true. But the advantage is that it makes your life a lot simpler. And I think that's the main reason the idea is so widespread. It is a comfortable idea.</td>

    <td>Craig Larman</td>
    <td>Explains the Protected Variation principle, which covers the Information Hiding and Open-Closed principles.</td>
    <td>QUOTE: For example, I recall being surprised by the occasional use of static public final fields in the Java technology libraries (after spending many years with the Smalltalk libraries). Some might be poorly conceived, but some, such as the Color static fields red, black, white, and so forth, are extremely stable; the likelihood of instability is so low that making them private and adding accessing methods is just object purism.</td>
