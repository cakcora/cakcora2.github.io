<h1>Social Coding</h1>

<p>[1] Social coding is an approach to software development that places an emphasis on formal and informal collaboration.
Although the term is often associated with social coding websites such as GitHub, BitBucket, CodePlex and Google Code, the term can be used to describe any development environment that encourages discussion and sharing. </p>

<p>[2] Social coding is an open, collaborative approach to product development. Hundreds of developers can work remotely, yet in real-time, to build or improve software code.</p>

<p>[3] "Social Coding": software development by a distributed, virtual community. Social coding requires the ability to provide collaborative authoring, using tools like wikis that are tied to specific artifacts, to the code. 
</p>

<p>[4] Social coding opens up opportunity for mutual growth and learning, and can also help with networking. It is an approach to coding that allows developers to collaborate in an environment that supports discussion, creation and sharing in order to code collaboratively in formal or informal settings.</p>

<p>[5] Social coding is an approach to software development that puts the focus on formal and informal collaboration. There are many benefits to social coding but the most important is probably the opportunity it presents for mutual growth and learning. Developers are allowed to collaborate in an environment that fosters discussion, creation and sharing.</p>

<p>[6] In projects on social coding, there are one or more developers as internal members of the project. Each project has a repository consisting of the
source codes and software documents. In each project, the internal members of the project write new codes and documents or change the existing ones to improve the software
or fix bugs, and add them to the repository via an operation called commit. Next, we introduce the behavior outside a project. The developers outside the project can bookmark
the project if they think the software created by the project is excellent. This operation is also called labeling with a star. The developers outside a project can join the project by
sending pull requests with codes that they wrote. Although whether or not the codes are accepted to the project is determined by the internal members, the pull requests enable the
internal and external members to collaborate.</p>

<p>[7] Social coding enables a different experience of software development as the activities and interests of one developer are easily advertized to other developers. Developers
can thus track the activities relevant to various projects in one umbrella site. </p>
