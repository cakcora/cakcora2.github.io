<h1>Social Coding</h1>

<p>[1] Social coding is an approach to software development that places an emphasis on formal and informal collaboration.

Although the term is often associated with social coding websites such as GitHub, BitBucket, CodePlex and Google Code, the term can be used to describe any development environment that encourages discussion and sharing. </p>

<p>[2] Social Coding is an open, collaborative approach to product development. Hundreds of developers can work remotely, yet in real-time, to build or improve software code.</p>
