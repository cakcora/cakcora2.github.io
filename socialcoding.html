<h1>Social Coding</h1>

<p><a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/social-coding">Tech Target:</a> Social coding is an approach to software development that places an emphasis on formal and informal <b>collaboration</b>.
Although the term is often associated with social coding websites such as GitHub, BitBucket, CodePlex and Google Code, the term can be used to describe any development environment that encourages <b>discussion</b> and <b>sharing</b>. </p>

<p><a href = "http://www.socialcoding4good.org/social-coding">Social Coding 4 Good:</a> Social coding is an <b>open</b>, <b>collaborative</b> approach to product development. Hundreds of developers can work <b>remotely</b>, yet in real-time, to build or improve software code.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/it-consultant/social-coding-the-next-wave-in-development/">Tech Republic:</a> "Social Coding": software development by a <b>distributed</b>, virtual <b>community</b>. Social coding requires the ability to provide <b>collaborative authoring</b>, using tools like wikis that are tied to specific artifacts, to the code. 
</p>

<p><a href="https://vsanywhere.com/web/what-is-social-coding/">Vsany:</a> Social coding opens up opportunity for <b>mutual growth</b> and learning, and can also help with networking. It is an approach to coding that allows developers to <b>collaborate</b> in an environment that supports <b>discussion</b>, creation and <b>sharing</b> in order to code collaboratively in formal or informal settings.</p>

<p><a href="http://devops.com/2014/04/25/social-coding/">DevOps:</a> Social coding is an approach to software development that puts the focus on <b>formal and informal collaboration</b>. There are many benefits to social coding but the most important is probably the opportunity it presents for <b>mutual growth</b> and learning. Developers are allowed to <b>collaborate</b> in an environment that fosters <b>discussion</b>, creation and <b>sharing</b>.</p>

<p>Yoshikawa et al. [1]: In projects on social coding, there are <b>one or more developers</b> as <b>internal members</b> of the project. Each project has a repository consisting of the
source codes and software documents. In each project, the internal members of the project write new codes and documents or change the existing ones to improve the software
or fix bugs, and add them to the repository via an operation called commit. Next, we introduce the behavior outside a project. The developers outside the project can bookmark
the project if they think the software created by the project is excellent. This operation is also called labeling with a star. The developers outside a project can join the project by
sending pull requests with codes that they wrote. Although whether or not the codes are accepted to the project is determined by the internal members, the pull requests enable the
internal and <b>external members</b> to <b>collaborate</b>.</p>

<p>Thung et al. [2] Social coding enables a different experience of software development as the activities and interests of one developer are easily <b>advertized</b> to other developers. Developers
can thus <b>track</b> the activities relevant to various projects in <b>one umbrella site</b>. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.javaworld.com/article/2600308/open-source-tools/githubs-new-ceo-were-serious-about-the-enterprise.html"><strong>Chris Wanstrath, GitHub CEO: </strong></a> Social coding is about <b>people</b>. Before we had a following, before we had any of the social features, all we wanted to do was make it really <b>easy to share</b> code with somebody else. It wasn't about what you were getting out of it; it was about what you were <b>doing with somebody else</b>. It's about the <b>commenting system</b>. It's about being able to look over a code <b>review</b>, get <b>feedback</b>, and sign off on it. It's about forking someone else's project and <b>showing them what you worked on</b>. There's a certain amount of friction in pushing changes to GitHub or changing navigation of the website. We always care about that. But the big picture is -- how do we make it <b>easier for people to work together</b>? What are new ways that we can get <b>different people working together</b>? That's social coding   </p>
